# Fully connected Generic Neural Network with sigmoid activation for supervised learning

This program creates a neural network programmatically with the following parameters:
- number of inputs
- number of neurons in hidden layer 1, ..., number of neurons in hidden layer n
- number of outputs
- learning rate

Once created the Neural Network has two functions:
- <b>Forward Propagation</b>: to generate a prediction or guess based on the inputs
- <b>Train</b>: to modify the inner weights and biases based on given inputs and target outputs

For testing purposes the XOR algorithm is implemented in the main.py script.
